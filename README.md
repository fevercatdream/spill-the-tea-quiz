# Spill the Tea

## Description

Create a timed multiple choice quiz. To create this quiz I learned how to use event listeners to respond to events such as buttons clicks dynamically. I learned how to move to different screen views. I learned how to store and retrieve date from local storage. I learned how to have have my quiz answers shuffled so that they change during each run through. I learned how to sort my high scores in descending order. I learned how to create a timer.

### User Story
